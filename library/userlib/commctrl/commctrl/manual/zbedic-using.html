<A name="layout"></A><H2>Layout</H2>

<P> Vertically the zbedic window is divided in three regions -- toolbar,
wordlist and description box.

<H3>Toolbar</H3>

The toolbar contains the controls that perform the zbedic actions.

<OL type="a">
	<LI>input box -- contains the word for lookup. You can use the
	dropdown to choose from the list of recently searched words.</LI>
	<LI>dictionary button -- selects a dictionary</LI>
	<LI>copy button -- copies the text that is selected to the clipboard</LI>
	<LI>paste button -- pastes from the clipboard to the input box</LI>
	<LI>settings button -- shows the settings dialog box</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Wordlist</H3>

<P>The control show the list of defined words that are lexicographically
after the word entered in the input box. The number of words shown can be
configured from the settings dialog box.

<H3>Description Box</H3>

<P>This box shows the word description. If the text in the input box is
subword of an existing word, the description of that word is shown.

<A name="settings"></A><H2>Settings</H2>

The Settings dialog box allows the user to configure zbedic. The
configuration parameters are:

<UL>
	<LI>Wordlist length -- number of words shown in the wordlist box</LI>
	<LI>History length -- number of words kept in the input box drop-down</LI>
	<LI>Dictionary Path -- colon separated list of directories that will
	be searched for dictionary files</LI>
	<LI>Font -- the font used in the application</LI>
	<LI>Save dictionary state on exit -- save the content of the input,
	wordlist and description boxes on exit and show it next time when
	zbedic is executed</LI>
	<LI>Show pronounciation -- for dictionaries that have pronounciation
	defined, this checkbox defines whether to show it or not. If you
	don't use a Unicode font that has the pronounciation symbols, you
	may want to disable the pronounciation</LI>
</UL>

<A name="qtreader"></A><H2>Integration with QTReader</H2>

<P>zbedic supports QCop interprocess messages. To setup QTReader to use
zbedic for word lookup, go to File->Set Dictionary and enter zbedic/find as
a message name.
