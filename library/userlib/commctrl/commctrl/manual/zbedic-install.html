<H3>Installing the runtime</H3>

<P>zbedic runtime comes as an ipk package. Use package manager to install it.

<H3>Installing dictionaries</H3>
<P>To use zbedic you have to download and install at least one dictionary.
See <A href="zbedic-dicts.html">Dictionaries</A> for the list of available
dictionaries and where to download them from.

<P>zbedic uses combination of two methods for finding dictinary files
installed on the Zaurus:

<UL>
	<LI> standard document-oriented method allowing you to store the
	dictionary anywhere</LI>

	<LI> lookup in a list of predefined directories</LI>
</UL>

<P>The first method is more user friendly, but there are complains that it
doesn't work for everybody. If you are sure you downloaded and installed the
dictionary file, but don't see it available, try the second method.

<P>Initially the directory list contains:

<PRE>
	/opt/QtPalmtop/share/zbedic
	/mnt/cf/opt/QtPalmtop/share/zbedic
	/mnt/card/opt/QtPalmtop/share/zbedic
</PRE>

<P>The list can be modified from the 
<A href="zbedic-using.html#settings">Settings</A> dialog box.

<H3>Fonts</H3>

<P>The standard fonts on the Zaurus contain only Latin1 characters. Some of the
dictionaries contain characters that are not covered by Latin1 (cyrillic,
chinese and japanese, pronounciation characters). If you want to use these
features, you have to install a font that contains these characters.

<P>One such font is unifont. You can download it for Zaurus from 
<A href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bedic">
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bedic</A>. To install it, just copy it
to /opt/QtPalmtop/lib/fonts and restart the Zaurus.
