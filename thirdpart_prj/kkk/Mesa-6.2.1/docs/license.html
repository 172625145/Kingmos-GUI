<p>
When contributing to the Mesa project you must agree to relinquish your
work to the holder of the copyright for the particular component you're
contributing to.  That is, you can't put your own copyright on the code,
unless it's a modular piece that can be omitted from Mesa (like a new
device driver).  If for example, you contribute a bug fix to Mesa's
texture mapping code, your code will become a part of the body of work
which is copyrighted by Brian Paul and licensed by the above terms.
